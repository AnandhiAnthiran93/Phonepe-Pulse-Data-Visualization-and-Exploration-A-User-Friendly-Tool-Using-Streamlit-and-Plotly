# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly
Introduction:

The objective of this project is to create a user friendly tool to extract the data from Phonepe pulse GitHub repository, process it to derive insights, and visualize it in an intuitive manner for users with the help of Streamlit and Plotly.

Technologies Used:

Github Cloning
Python
Pandas
MySQL
Streamlit
Plotly
Process Involved:

Data Extraction: Clone the GitHub repository and retrieve the data from Phonepe Pulse.

Data Transformation: Data manipulation, cleaning, and formatting to prepare it for analysis and visualization using python and Pandas library.

Database Insertion: The processed data is stored in MySQL database efficiently.

Dashboard Creation: Develop a dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python. Utilize Plotly's geo map functions to create an interactive map-based visualization. Incorporate dropdown options for users to select different data points.

Data Retrieval: Fetch data from the MySQL database into a Pandas dataframe, facilitating dynamic updates to the dashboard.

Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Thoroughly test the application and deploy the dashboard publicly for accessibility.

Results:
The outcome of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard offering insights and information derived from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. With at least 10 different dropdown options, users can select various facts and figures for display. The data will reside in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval, and the dashboard will dynamically update to reflect the latest information.
Overall, this project delivers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for data extraction, transformation, and visualization from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
